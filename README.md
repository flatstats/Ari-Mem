# Ari-Mem the Adaptive AI Memory System

## Overview

This project is an adaptive memory system designed to enhance AI reasoning by introducing long-term context retention, weighted prioritization, and contextual linking. It enables AI models to remember, retrieve, and evolve knowledge over time, bridging the gap between static recall and dynamic cognition.

## Why It Matters

Most AI models lack true memory—they rely solely on input context, forgetting previous interactions. This system aims to change that by providing:

- **Contextual Awareness** – Memories are retrieved based on similarity and weighted importance.
- **Dynamic Learning** – Stored knowledge adapts based on usage and updates over time.
- **Persistent Reasoning** – Enables AI to recall key insights across sessions.

## Features

- **Weighted Memory Storage** – Prioritizes frequently referenced or critical information.
- **Adaptive Retrieval** – Returns the most relevant memories while maintaining diversity.
- **Contextual Linking** – Connects related memories to build an evolving knowledge network.
- **Self-Optimizing Updates** – Avoids redundancy while refining stored knowledge.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

#### Store a Memory

```python
from memory_system import store_memory

store_memory("You love lilac-colored things.", weight=1.5, tags=["preference"])
```

#### Retrieve Memories

```python
from memory_system import retrieve_memories

retrieve_memories("lilac")
```

#### Update a Memory

```python
from memory_system import update_memory

update_memory(memory_id, "You love lilac and soft pastel colors.")
```

## Potential Applications

- **Personal AI Assistants** – Retaining user preferences and evolving over time.
- **Research & Analysis** – Storing insights for progressive refinement.
- **Conversational AI** – Maintaining context beyond a single chat session.

## Future Enhancements

- **Integration with Local/Cloud LLMs** – Connecting to OpenAI models for deeper reasoning.
- **Multimodal Memory** – Expanding beyond text to support images, audio, and structured data.
- **Reinforcement Learning Framework** – Allowing memory to influence AI decision-making.

This is a **work in progress**, but the goal is clear: creating AI that doesn’t just process data, but **remembers, adapts, and grows**.
